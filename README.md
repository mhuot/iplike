# Advanced IP Address String Matching for PostgreSQL

While PostgreSQL has native support for IP addresses, there are use
cases for text columns when you either have a legacy database
schema or need more control over how addresses are stored.

IPLIKE is a PostgreSQL plugin for doing wildcard-like IP address
matching using a simple rule grammar.


# Building from Source

## Preparing a Git Checkout for Building

If you checked IPLIKE out from Git, you will need to prepare the build
directory.  If you downloaded a source tarball you can skip this step.

You will need to have GNU Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool installed.

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
autoreconf -fvi
```

## Building

Building uses the standard GNU Autoconf process:


```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

If your PostgreSQL is in a non-standard location, you can compile
against it by passing `--with-pgsql=/path/to/pg_config` to the
`./configure` command.

## Creating RPM Packages

If RPM is detected, the source build will also have support for
building RPM packages.  Just run:

```
./configure
make rpm
```

## Creating Debian/Ubuntu Packages

Debian IPLIKE packages are named to match the PostgreSQL version
they are built against, so that multiple IPLIKE packages can
be installed at the same time (`iplike-pgsql9.5`, `iplike-pgsql10`,
and so on).

For this reason, you first must run `configure` before doing the
normal Debian packaging process.

```
./configure
dpkg-buildpackage
```


# Installing IPLIKE to PostgreSQL

You should be able to run the `install_iplike.sh` script to insert
IPLIKE into your database.  By default it will associate it with
a database called `opennms`, but you can choose a different database
by passing the `-d` flag (eg, `-d template1`).


# Using IPLIKE

IPLIKE uses a very flexible search format, allowing you to separate
the octets (fields) of an IPv4 or IPv6 address into specific searches.
An asterisk (*) in place of any octet matches any value for that octet.
Ranges are indicated by two numbers separated by a dash (-),
and commas are used for lists of matching octets.

## Example Queries

Match all addresses from 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.255:

* `SELECT iplike(ipaddr, '192.168.*.*');`
* `SELECT iplike(ipaddr, '192.168.0-255.0-255');`
* `SELECT iplike(ipaddr, '192.168.*.0-255');`

Match any link-local IPv6 address:

* `SELECT iplike(ipaddr, 'fe80:*:*:*:*:*:*:*');`

# Releasing packages

Creating a release is triggered by pushing a version tag following the semantic versioning schema using `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`, e.g. `v2.3.1`.
The `main` branch is equivalent to the latest released version.
The steps to prepare and publish a release:

1. Create a changelog entry in the `debian/changelog.tmpl` file with the changes and the new version number.
2. Set the version in `version.m4` file
3. Commit to the main branch and verify if CI/CD goes green
4. Push a version tag from main to publish the release
5. Fill the release notes with the same content as the `debian/changelog.tmpl` entry

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The version number in the `debian/changelog.tmpl` drives the Debian package version number and is important.

# Testing GitHub Workflow with Act

You can locally test changes to GitHub workflows using [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act), which simulates the GitHub Actions environment on your local machine.

### Instructions

1. **Initialize Git Submodules** (if your project uses them):
    ```bash
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ```

2. **Run Act:**
* Set ACTPATH to the path where act is installed. Replace `/path/to/act` with your actual installation path if necessary:

    ```bash
    export ACTPATH=/path/to/act
    ```

* Run act to test the push event, specifying an artifact output path:

    ```bash
    $ACTPATH/act push --artifact-server-path ~/output
    ```

Notes:

Make sure act is installed and accessible. You can install it by following the instructions [`here`](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation).
The `--artifact-server-path` `~/output` option saves artifacts to `~/output`, which you can customize as needed.
